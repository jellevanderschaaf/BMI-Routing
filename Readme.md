Making a humble beginning with Node.js and Express.js by creating a BMI-calculator on a local server.


1. Create an HTML form, this form will make a post request to our server at the route /bmicalculator. The form will have 2 inputs, weight and height.

2. Add a button which says “Caculate BMI”

3. Add the get and post methods for the /bmicalculator route into the same server.js file we've been using.

4. Use sendFile() to send the bmiCalculator.html page as a response inside the get method.

5. Inside server.js , create 2 variables, one for weight and one for height. 

6. Write code to calculate and send back the result as text.
